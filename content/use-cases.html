                    <h3>Simplification</h3>
                    <p><b>Requirement</b>: There must be a mechanism to  identify and differentiate the  features included in web content based on its importance (e.g. critical, high, medium, low). The definition of a feature's importance should be defined from the user's perspective as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Critical &mdash; used by the majority of users 90% of the time or more.</li>
                       <li>High &mdash; used at least 60% of the time or more.</li>
                       <li>Medium &mdash;  used by 20% of users, 20% of the time.</li>
                       <li>Low &mdash; used less then 20%.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><b>User experience</b>: A user changes their personalization settings to simplify the web content that displays based on the importance of various features.  In the sample user experience available at <a href="https://rawgit.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/demo/conactUs.html">https://rawgit.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/demo/conactUs.html</a>, the user can select a &quot;More options button or &quot;Less options&quot; button to simplify the web content by hiding or displaying elements that are or of low importance.</p>

    <h3>Adding Context</h3>
                    <p><b>Requirement:</b> Terms and symbols used in web content must be  familiar to the user because what is familiar to one user may be unrecognizable or strange to someone else requiring the user to learn new symbols. Therefore, the user agent or script should understand the context of links, buttons, and other page elements so that symbols and text displayed in a way each  user understands. This can include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Familiar Symbols and graphics that they are familiar with </li>
                        <li>Tooltips </li>
                        <li>Language translation</li>
                        <li>Keyboard shortcuts </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In order to display the appropriate content the supported syntax and terms must be standardized using attributes to associate symbols, terms, translations and explanations that  are presented in a way that is understandable by various user scenarios.</p>
                    <p><b>Example user experience:</b>: A web content author creates a button with a role="send" then, without any additional work by the author the web content automatically:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Renders associated symbols, terms, and/or tooltips that are understandable by a particular user.</li>
                        <li>Includudes F1 help that explains how the send function works in simple terms. </li>
                        <li>Has an identified keyboard shortcut that is always used for the send function.</li>
                        <li>Identifies the send button as important so it is always rendered, or rendered as a large button if needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Standardizing content with the appropriate attributes can help to ensure a consistent user experience across applications and websites.</p>

                        <p><b>Requirement</b>: Optimize the personalization of a product or service's content to ensure it is appropriate for the current context of use as well as relevant for the user.</p>
                        <p><b>User experience</b>: A female user with a cognitive disability may need to select &quot;Less options&quot;, while shopping on a website to eliminate options that are not relevant to a her shopping needs.  In this case it may be appropriate to demote these options  to display below the scroll or placed under a &quot;More option&quot; button.</p>

                        <h4>Interoperable Symbols</h4>
                        <p><b>Requirement</b>: Create interoperable symbol sets for users with complex communication needs that require the use of Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) systems. AAC systems are designed for people who are non-verbal that often use symbols with or without text. AAC end-users tend to only learn one symbol set and cannot easily communicate with other symbol users in a written format. In addition, they may struggle to understand different symbols that are used in different applications. It's important to note that some symbols may be subject to copyright, which means they cannot be shared across applications. However, there are open symbol sets that can be shared and mapped against concepts, generating representative text. This text can also be translated into different languages as well as used to display a different set of symbols.</p>
                        
                        <p><b>User experience</b>: Mapping an AAC users' symbols to the same concepts enables the user agent to load the appropriate symbols enabling  the user to understand and access content on the web and in other applications. In addition, AAC users, and those working with AAC users will be able to load AAC user symbols into these  applications enabling access to content that has been created by different providers.</p>
