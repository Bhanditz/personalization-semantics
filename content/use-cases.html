                    <h3>Simplification</h3>
                    <p><b>Requirement</b>: The user must be able to request a way to identify and differentiate between critical features, medium features and less important features. These need to be defined as important from a user perspective in the content. Typically, critical features may be used by many or most users, 90% of the time or more. Highly important features would be above 60% use. Medium important features would be 20% of users use it 20% of the time. Under 20% usage would be of low importance.</p>
                    <p><b>User experience</b>: Based on personalization setting the user can see less options. A sample user experience is available at <a href="https://rawgit.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/demo/conactUs.html">https://rawgit.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/demo/conactUs.html </a></p>

                    <h3>Adding Context</h3>
                    <p><b>Requirement:</b> Having familiar terms and symbols is key to being able to use the web. However, what is familiar for one user may be strange for another, requiring them to learn new symbols. If a user agent or script knows the context of links, buttons, and other page elements then symbols and text used can be ones that the user understands. This can include: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Symbols and graphics that they are familiar with </li>
                        <li> Tooltips </li>
                        <li> Language the use can understand </li>
                        <li> Keyboard shortcuts </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>For that we need to standardize supportive syntax and terms that can be linked to associated symbols, terms, translations and explanations, for the individual, via an attribute.</p>
                    <p><b>Example user experience:</b> If an author gives to a button a role "send" then, without any work by the author, the button could be automatically rendered with a symbol, term, and/or tooltips that is understandable by a particular user. It could automatically imply F1 help that explains the send function in simple terms. It could be identified with a keyboard shortcut that will always be used for send. In addition, it could be identified as important and always rendered, or rendered as a large button. This would enable a consistent UI experience across applications and websites.</p>

                        <h4>General Context</h4>
                        <p><b>Requirement: </b> One important factor in optimizing the personalization of a product or service is to ensure that the personalization is appropriate for the current context of use as well as what is relevant for the user. For example a female user with a cognitive disability may need less options, and options that are for men are less likely to be relevant for her and may be demoted to below the scroll or placed under a &quot;more option&quot; button.</p>

                        <h4>Interoperable Symbols</h4>
                        <p><b>Requirement:</b> We would like to create interoperable symbol sets for those with complex communication needs using Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) systems. AAC systems designed for people who are non-verbal often use symbols with or without text. End-users tend to only learn one symbol set and cannot easily communicate with other symbol users in a written format or may struggle to understand different symbols used in different applications. Some symbols are subject to copyright and cannot be shared across applications. However, there are open symbol sets that can be shared and mapped against concepts, generating representative text. This text can be translated into different languages and even used to present a different set of symbols. If users' symbols are mapped to the same concepts then user agents can load the user understandable symbols and enable access to the web and other applications.</p>
                        <p>User experience: AAC users, those working with AAC users and others will be able to load symbols that they understand into different applications that have been made by a different provider.</p>
