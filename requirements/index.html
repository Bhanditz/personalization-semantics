				<h3>Simplification</h3>
				<p><b>Requirement</b>: There must be a mechanism to  identify and differentiate the  features included in web content based on its importance (e.g. critical, high, medium, low). The definition of a feature's importance should be defined from the user's perspective as:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><code>Critical</code> — used by the majority of users 90% of the time or more.</li>
					<li><code>High</code> — used at least 60% of the time or more.</li>
					<li><code>Medium</code> —  used by 20% of users, 20% of the time.</li>
					<li><code>Low</code> — used less then 20%.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p><b>User experience</b>: A user changes their personalization settings to simplify the web content that displays based on the importance of various features.  In the sample user experience available at <a href="https://rawgit.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/demo/conactUs.html">https://rawgit.com/ayelet-seeman/coga.personalisation/demo/conactUs.html</a>, the user can select a &quot;More options button or &quot;Less options&quot; button to simplify the web content by hiding or displaying elements that are or of low importance.</p>

			<section id="use_case_adding_context">
				
				<h3>Adding Context</h3>
				<p><b>Requirement:</b> Terms and symbols used in web content must be  familiar to the user because what is familiar to one user may be unrecognizable or strange to someone else requiring the user to learn new symbols. Therefore, the user agent or script should understand the context of links, buttons, and other page elements so that symbols and text displayed in a way each  user understands. This can include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Familiar Symbols and graphics that they are familiar with </li>
					<li>Tooltips </li>
					<li>Language translation</li>
					<li>Keyboard shortcuts </li>
				</ul>
				<p>In order to display the appropriate content the supported syntax and terms must be standardized using attributes to associate symbols, terms, translations and explanations that  are presented in a way that is understandable by various user scenarios.</p>
				<p><b>Example user experience:</b>: A web content author creates a button with a role="send" then, without any additional work by the author the web content automatically:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Renders associated symbols, terms, and/or tooltips that are understandable by a particular user.</li>
					<li>Includudes F1 help that explains how the send function works in simple terms. </li>
					<li>Has an identified keyboard shortcut that is always used for the send function.</li>
					<li>Identifies the send button as important so it is always rendered, or rendered as a large button if needed.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Standardizing content with the appropriate attributes can help to ensure a consistent user experience across applications and websites.</p>

					<h4>General Context</h4>
					<p><b>Requirement</b>: Optimize the personalization of a product or service's content to ensure it is appropriate for the current context of use as well as relevant for the user.</p>
					<p><b>User experience</b>: A female user with a cognitive disability may need to select &quot;Less options&quot;, while shopping on a website to eliminate options that are not relevant to a her shopping needs.  In this case it may be appropriate to demote these options  to display below the scroll or placed under a &quot;More option&quot; button.</p>

				<section id="use_case_interoperable_symbols">
					<h4>Interoperable Symbols</h4>
					<p><b>Requirement</b>: Create interoperable symbol sets for users with complex communication needs that require the use of Alternative and Augmentative Communication (AAC) systems. AAC systems are designed for people who are non-verbal that often use symbols with or without text. AAC end-users tend to only learn one symbol set and cannot easily communicate with other symbol users in a written format. In addition, they may struggle to understand different symbols that are used in different applications. It's important to note that some symbols may be subject to copyright, which means they cannot be shared across applications. However, there are open symbol sets that can be shared and mapped against concepts, generating representative text. This text can also be translated into different languages as well as used to display a different set of symbols.</p>
					
					<p><b>User experience</b>: Mapping an AAC users' symbols to the same concepts enables the user agent to load the appropriate symbols enabling  the user to understand and access content on the web and in other applications. In addition, AAC users, and those working with AAC users will be able to load AAC user symbols into these  applications enabling access to content that has been created by different providers.</p>

			<section id="use_case_numberfree">
				<h2>Number Free</h2>
				<p><strong>Requirement</strong>: Not everyone can understand numbers. The <code>numberfree</code> attribute is intended as an alternative text for people who can not understand the main content.</p>
				<p><strong>User experience:</strong></p>
				<p>A suggested user experience would be: Numerical concepts could be rendered by the user agent slightly different so that the user knows a number free explanation is available. The user can then focus on the content and a tooltip or other disclosure mechanism would give the number free value.</p>

			<section id="use_case_language">
				<h2>Language Type Support</h2>
				<p><strong>Requirement: </strong>Authors may want to provide a simplified version of the page or of a section of a page. For example, you may wish to provide a simplified summary of legal document, but still have a longer version for other users. These alternative versions may not be identical in content but maintain the intent of the original content.</p>

			<section id="use_case_literal">
				<h2>Non-literal Text and Images</h2>
				<p><strong>Requirement: </strong>Some users cannot understand non-literal text and icons such as metaphors, idioms etc. The <code>literal</code> property is intended to identify text or images as non-literal and allows the author to explain non-literal text and images to users.</p>
				<p><strong>User experience:</strong></p>
				<p>A suggested user experience would be: Non-literal content could be rendered by the user agent with an indication that signifies to the user that this content should not be taken literally and that a literal explanation is available. The user can then place focus on the content and a tooltip or other disclosure mechanism would give the literal value.</p>

			<section id="use_case_morehelp">
				<h3>More Help</h3>
				<p><strong>Requirement: </strong>Some users may need additional information or specifically additional help information. We propose additional properties so that an author can indicate the existence of this additional information.</p>

				<h2>Explain and Feedback</h2>
				<p><strong>Requirement: </strong></p>
				<p>Some users need additional help. We propose additional properties where the author can provide additional information or explain what just happened.</p>

			</section>
			<section id="use_case_stepindicator">
				<h3 id="stepindicator">Step Indicator</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>Requirement:</strong> Users may have differences in both working and short-term memory. For some users the duration of working memory may be shorter than the average which is between 10-15 seconds. For some users the duration of short-term memory may be shorter than the average which is between 15-30 seconds.</p>
				<p> Many processes consist of a sequence of separate steps or actions which must be performed by a user to complete a process or workflow. Users must be able to track completed tasks in order to identify their location in a process. In addition, a user must be able to navigate to completed tasks to make modifications or corrections.</p>
				<p>The suggested defined values allow an author to transform information associated with steps within a process or represent the entire user path including steps out of the context of a defined process and steps between defined processes
					into breadcrumbs or linked steps that identify completed tasks, allow the user to make edits to steps that have been completed and identify a user' current location in a user path.</p>
				<p><strong>Example User Experience:</strong> A hyperlinked, sequential breadcrumb list displays in the header, allowing the user agent to build a sequential indicator that displays a link to each page in the order it was visited by the user. </p>
				<p><strong>Note</strong>: I believe an important feature is that this mechanism can cross defined tasks and give a more holistic version of the user flow. Typically in a defined sequence of tasks an author will have provided the nessessary afforardance, location in the path, navigation through the path, etc., in the UI by design.</p>

			<section id="use_case_reminder">
				<h3 id="reminder">Reminders and Messages</h3>
				<p>
					<strong>Requirement: </strong>A mechanism for managing both system level and application level reminders and messages is a useful tool for people with a variety of cognitive disabilities including, memory impairment and users who are sensitive to distractions. We require a group of defined values that give users control over the amount of reminders and messages that are presented along with a mechanism for managing, prioritizing, managing and grouping reminders and messages.</p>
				<p>For example, users can disable push notifications and messages on applications such as Skype and Facebook across different devices, however, they may forget to re-enable these notifications and messages. The following defined values allow an alternative solution for users to manage reminders and messages by forming a cross-application and cross-device matrix that manages all reminders and messages. These values are based on a matrix for reminders and messages at the operating system, browser or cloud level. A user's contacts can be organized by importance or by groups. For example, the CEO of the company a user works for and a user's child care giver could both be set to critical. A user's contacts may also be grouped. Family members es.</p>

Family members may be in one group, important colleagues may be in a second group, and friends in a third group.</p>
				<p><strong>Privacy Implications:</strong>This feature could in theory be implemented pre-authentication. Depending on the implementation, this would expose a users contats to the client in clear text. </p>
				<p><strong>Existing Technologies:</strong> Would Web push notification with customization by the user satisfy the requirement here as opposed to introducing new semantics?</p>
				<p>Reference: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/codelabs/push-notifications/</p>
				<p><strong>Example User Experience:</strong> Question for the group. How would data be shared, if at all, between applications containing, for example, contacts and the proposed mechanism</p>
