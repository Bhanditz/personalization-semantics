			<p>Personalization involves tailoring aspects of the user experience to meet the needs and preferences of the individual user. For example, having familiar terms and symbols is key to many users being able to use the web. However, what is familiar for one user may not be familiar to another, requiring them to learn new symbols. The challenge has been the ability to identify the types of content in a document that should be adapted to the preferred user experience. The introduction of standardized semantics allows web applications to customize the presentation of that content to one that is familiar to individuals based on their specificneeds and preferences. This specification defines standard semantics to enable user driven personalization. For example, the association of user-preferred symbols with elements having those semantics. This ensures that users can quickly find familiar icons, for example, a help icon, within the context of user interface elements.</p>
			<p>This document is an explanation for understanding how to use Personalization properties to personalize an accessible web site.</p>

			<h1>Introduction</h1>
			<p>The goals of this specification include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Expanding the accessibility information that may be supplied by the author;</li>
				<li> Facilitate preference driven individual personalization;</li>
				<li> Enable the author to specify key semantics needed to support users with cognitive impairments</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is a proposal for defining syntax for adaptable content such as: links, buttons, symbols, help and keyboard. This may be a WAI-ARIA COGA Extension, however implemenation methods are currently being explored.</p>
			<!--<p>Personalization involves tailoring aspects of the user experience to meet the preferences or needs of the user. For example, having familiar terms and symbols is key to being able to use the web. However what is familiar for one user may be new for another requiring them to learn new symbols. Personalization could include loading a set of symbols that is appropriate for the specific user, ensuring that all users find the icons simple and familiar.</p> -->
			<p>Technology holds the promise of being extremely flexible and the design of many systems includes the expectation that users will be able to optimize their interaction experience according to their personal preferences or accessibility needs. </p>
			<section class="section" id="why_accessibility">
				<h2>Why We Need Personalization</h2>
				<p>We need personalization because: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>The needs of individual user may conflict.</li>
					<li>Learning new design patterns, widgets, and user interfaces can be confusing. We would like to give users the ability to decide what works best for them based on preference and ability.</li>
					<li>Extra support can be a distraction for people who do not need it.</li>
					<li>Making content predictable is necessary for accessibility but can often lead to less innovate design.</li>
					<li>Ability to increase of decrease levels of complexity as people's skills improve or decline over time.</li>
					<li>Enable websites to adapt to and meet the user's needs.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Some users need extra support. This can include: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Symbols and graphics that they are familiar with</li>
					<li>Tooltips</li>
					<li>Language they understand</li>
					<li>Less features</li>
					<li>Separating advertisements so users don't confuse them with native content </li>
					<li>Keyboard short cuts</li>
				</ul>
				<p>To achieve this we need standardized terms and supportive syntax. These can be linked to associated symbols, terms, translations and explanations. They are then provided to an individual based on personal preferences.</p>
				<p>For example, assume an author can make it programmatically known that a button sends an email. Based on user preferences, the button renders with a symbol, term, and/or tooltips that are understandable by this particular user. It could automatically include F1 help that explains the send function in simple terms. It could be identified with a keyboard short cut that is always used for send. In addition, the button could be identified as important and always rendered, or always rendered very large. </p>
				<p>Working examples of how this could be used in practice, with user preferences, are available on the task force <a href="https://github.com/w3c/personalization-semantics/wiki/Implementations-of-Semantics">implementations page</a>. </p>
					<p>Another use-case we would like to see is interoperable symbol set codes for non-verbal people. Products for people who are non-vocal often use symbols to help users communicate. These symbols are in fact an individual's language. Unfortunately many of these symbols are both subject to copyright and are not interoperable. That means end-users can only use one device, and can not use applications or assistive technologies from a different company. An open set of references for symbol codes for these symbol sets however, could be interoperable. That means the end user could use an open source symbol set or buy the symbols and use them across different devices or applications. Symbols could still be proprietary but they would also be interoperable.</p>

			<h1>Structure of Properties</h1>
			<p>Semantic properties have the characteristics described in the following sections.</p>
			<section id="propcharacteristic_value">
				<h2>Value</h2>
				<p>Value type of the semantic property. The value may be one of the following types:</p>
				<dl>
					<dt id="valuetype_true-false">true/false</dt>
					<dd>Value representing either true or false, with a default &quot;false&quot; value.</dd>
					<dt id="valuetype_true-false-undefined">true/false/undefined</dt>
					<dd>Value representing true or false, with a default &quot;undefined&quot; value indicating the state or property is not relevant.</dd>
					<dt id="valuetype_idref">ID reference</dt>
					<dd>Reference to the ID of another element in the same document</dd>
					<dt id="valuetype_idref_list">ID reference list</dt>
					<dd>A list of one or more ID references.</dd>
					<dt id="valuetype_integer">integer</dt>
					<dd>A numerical value without a fractional component.</dd>
					<dt id="valuetype_number">number</dt>
					<dd>Any real numerical value.</dd>
					<dt id="valuetype_string">string</dt>
					<dd>Unconstrained value type.</dd>
					<dt id="valuetype_token">token</dt>
					<dd>One of a limited set of allowed values.</dd>
					<dt id="valuetype_token_list">token list</dt>
					<dd>A list of one or more tokens.</dd>
					<dt id="valuetype_uri">URI</dt>
					<dd>A Uniform Resource Identifier as defined by <cite><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC 3986</a></cite> [[RFC3986]]. It may reference a separate document, or a content fragment identifier in a separate document, or a content fragment identifier within the same document.</dd>
				</dl>
				<p>The "undefined" value, when allowed on a state or property, is an explicit indication that the state or property is not set. The value is used on states and properties that support tokens, and the &quot;undefined&quot; value is a string that is one of the allowed tokens. It is also used on some states and properties that accept true/false values, when &quot;undefined&quot; has a different meaning than &quot;false&quot;.</p>
				<p>These are generic types for states and properties, but do not define specific representation. See <a href="#state_property_processing" class="specref">State and Property Attribute Processing</a> for details on how these values are expressed and handled in host languages.</p>

				<h2>Modules</h2>
				<p>This specification has been divided into modules. </p>
				<p>Each module has use cases and vocabularies: </p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="content/index.html">Adaptable Content:</a>
					<p>This section provides vocabularies that enable user agents to augment or adapt content to the user scenario and helps the user use and understand the content.</p>
					<p>It includes use cases and vocabularies for identifying the purpose of controls, symbols  and user interface elements and supports simplification and distractions.</p></li>
				
					<li><a href="help/index.html">Adaptable Help and Support:</a>
					<p>This module is not yet published but an early draft is available.</p>
					<p>It addresses adding information about the content to enable help scaffolding and additional support for different user scenarios.</p></li>
				
					<li><a href="tools/index.html">Adaptable Tools</a>
					<p>This module is not yet published but an early draft is available.</p>
					<p>It addresses adding information about the content to enable user agents and new extensions that support the user such as adaptable breadcrumbs.</p></li>

                <p>HELP NEEDED!</p>
                <p>The Personalization Task Force is looking for advice on choosing an implementation mechanism.  We have considered a number of different approaches all with varying pros and cons with either excess burden on host languages or on authoring.</p>
                <p>See our Pros/Cons discussion <a href="https://github.com/w3c/personalization-semantics/wiki/Comparison-of-ways-to-use-vocabulary-in-content">Comparison of ways to use vocabulary in content</a>, on the various alternatives we have identified.

				<h3>Mapping Values to Different Syntax </h3>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Vocabulary Identification</h3>
				<p>Metadata languages that support this vocabulary need to distinguish terms coming from the personalization semantics vocabulary, from terms in other vocabularies. This document proposes two identifications mechanisms, which may be used separately or together according to the needs of the metadata language. These are the <strong>prefix</strong> and the <strong>identification URI</strong>.</p>
				<section>
					<h4>Prefix</h4>
					<p>The prefix for personalization semantics is "<strong>aui</strong>", which is an acronym of "accessible user interface". Implementations that use a prefix to identify terms from this vocabulary should use that prefix.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h4>Identification URI</h4>
					<p>The identification URI for personalization semantics is <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/aui/</code>. Implementations that use a URI to identify terms from this vocabulary should use that URI.</p>
				</section>
			</section>
            
			<section>
				<h3>WAI-ARIA</h3>
				<p>Properties in this case can be represented as WAI-ARIA properties by adding the prefix "aui-" to the attribute name, and the property value as the attribute value.</p>
				<p class="ednote">The prefix above is not yet accepted by the ARIA Working Group.</p>
				<div class="example">

				<h3>HTML Microdata</h3>
				
				<p>Properties in this vocabulary can be applied via <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/">HTML Microdata</a> [[microdata]]. To apply a term from this vocabulary to content using Microdata, use the following steps:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>On the element to which a property applies, set the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/#dfn-itemscope"><code>itemscope</code> attribute</a>. </li>
					<li>On the element for which <code>itemscope</code> is set, set the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/#dfn-itemtype"><code>itemtype</code> attribute</a> to the personalizaton semantics <a href="#identification-uri">identification URI</a>.</li>
					<li>On the same element or a descendant element, as appropriate to the context, set the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/#dfn-attr-itemprop"><code>itemprop</code> attribute</a>, using the name of the personalization semantics property as the value of the attribute.</li>
					<li>On the element for which <code>itemprop</code> is set, set the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/#dfn-content"><code>content</code> attribute</a> to the appropriate value for the property.</li>
				</ul>
				<pre class="example" title="Action property in HTML using HTML Microdata">
