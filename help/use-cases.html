                    <h2>Number Free</h2>
                    <p><strong>Requirement</strong>: Not everyone can understand numbers. The <code>numberfree</code> attribute is intended as an alternative text for people who can not understand the main content.</p>
                    <p><strong>User experience:</strong></p>
                    <p>A suggested user experience would be: Numerical concepts could be rendered by the user agent slightly different so that the user knows a number free explanation is available. The user can then focus on the content and a tooltip or other disclosure mechanism would give the number free value.</p>

                    <p><strong>Requirement: </strong>Authors may want to provide a simplified version of the page or of a section of a page. For example, you may wish to provide a simplified summary of legal document, but still have a longer version for other users. These alternative versions may not be identical in content but maintain the intent of the original content.</p>

                    <p><strong>Requirement: </strong>Some users cannot understand non-literal text and icons such as metaphors, idioms etc. The <code>literal</code> property is intended to identify text or images as non-literal and allows the author to explain non-literal text and images to users.</p>

                    <p>A suggested user experience would be: Non-literal content could be rendered by the user agent with an indication that signifies to the user that this content should not be taken literally and that a literal explanation is available. The user can then place focus on the content and a tooltip or other disclosure mechanism would give the literal value.</p>
