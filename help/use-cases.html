                    <h2>Number Free</h2>
                    <p><strong>Requirement</strong>: Not everyone can understand numbers. We therefor suggest <code>numberfree</code> for alternative text for people who can not understand the main content</p>
                    <p><strong>User experience:</strong></p>
                    <p>A suggested user experience would be: Numerical concepts could be rendered by the user agent slightly different so that the user knows a number free explanation is available. The user can then mouse over the content and a tooltips would give the number free value</p>
