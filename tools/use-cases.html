    <b>Requirement:</b> Users may have differences in both working and short-term memory. For some users the duration of working memory may be shorter than the average which is between 10-15 seconds. For some users the duration of short-term memory may be shorter than the average which is between 15-30 seconds.
  <p> Many processes consist of a sequence of separate steps or actions which must be performed by a user to complete a process or workflow. Users must be able to track completed tasks in order to identify their location in a process. In addition, a user must be able to navigate to completed tasks to make modifications or corrections.</P.
  <p>The suggested attrributes allow the author to transform information associated with steps in a process
into breadcrumbs that identify completed tasks, allow the user to make edits to steps that have been completed and allow the system to present more or less information associated with completed steps based on user preferences.</p>
  <p><b>Example User Experience:</b> A hyperlinked, sequential breadcrumb list displays in the header, allowing the user agent to build a <del>cross application</del> sequential indicator that displays each task in the order it was completed by the user. </p>

  <h3>Reminders and Messages</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Requirement: </strong>A mechanism for managing both system level and application level reminders and messages are a useful tool for people with a variety of cognitive disabilities including memory impairment and users who are sensitive to distracations. We require an attribute that gives users control over the amount of reminders and messages are generated and how reminders and messages are managed and grouped.<p>
    <p>For example, users can disable push notifications and messages on applications such as Skype and Facebook across different devices, however, they may forget to re-enable these notifications and messages. The following attributes allow an alternative solution for users to manage reminders and messages by forming a cross-application and cross-device matrix that manages all reminders and messages. These attributes are based on a matrix for reminders and messages at the operating system, browser or cloud level. A user's contacts can be organized by importance or by groups. For example, the CEO of the company a user works for and a user's child's care giver could both be set to critical. A user's contacts may also be grouped. Family members may be in one group, important colleagues may be in a second group, and friends in a third group.</p>
  <p>Relevant properties:
    <a href="#x3-2-1-messageimportance">messageimportance</a>,
    <a href="#x3-2-2-messagefrom">messagefrom</a>,
    <a href="#x3-2-3-messagecontext">messagecontext</a>,
    <a href="#x3-2-4-messagetime">messagetime</a>
   <p>
    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> I don't see a grouping attribute here. Are we sure we have all the attributes defined? I can do some work on this.
