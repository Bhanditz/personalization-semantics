  <h3 id="stepindicator">Step Indicator</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Requirement:</strong> Users may have differences in both working and short-term memory. For some users the duration of working memory may be shorter than the average which is between 10-15 seconds. For some users the duration of short-term memory may be shorter than the average which is between 15-30 seconds.
  <p> Many processes consist of a sequence of separate steps or actions which must be performed by a user to complete a process or workflow. Users must be able to track completed tasks in order to identify their location in a process. In addition, a user must be able to navigate to completed tasks to make modifications or corrections.</p>
  <p>The suggested defined values allow an author to transform information associated with steps within a process or represent the entire user path including steps out of the context of a defined process and steps between defined processes
into breadcrumbs or linked steps that identify completed tasks, allow the user to make edits to steps that have been completed and identify a user' current location in a user path.</p>
  <p><strong>Example User Experience:</strong> A hyperlinked, sequential breadcrumb list displays in the header, allowing the user agent to build a sequential indicator that displays a link to each page in the order it was visited by the user. </p>
   <p><strong>Note</strong>: I believe an important feature is that this mechanism can cross defined tasks and give a more holistic version of the user flow. Typically in a defined sequence of tasks an author will have provided the nessessary afforardance, location in the path, navigation through the path, etc., in the UI by design.</p>

  <h3 id="reminder">Reminders and Messages</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Requirement: </strong>A mechanism for managing both system level and application level reminders and messages is a useful tool for people with a variety of cognitive disabilities including, memory impairment and users who are sensitive to distractions. We require a group of defined values that give users control over the amount of reminders and messages that are presented along with a mechanism for managing, prioritizing, managing and grouping reminders and messages.<p>
    <p>For example, users can disable push notifications and messages on applications such as Skype and Facebook across different devices, however, they may forget to re-enable these notifications and messages. The following defined values allow an alternative solution for users to manage reminders and messages by forming a cross-application and cross-device matrix that manages all reminders and messages. These values are based on a matrix for reminders and messages at the operating system, browser or cloud level. A user's contacts can be organized by importance or by groups. For example, the CEO of the company a user works for and a user's child care giver could both be set to critical. A user's contacts may also be grouped. Family members es.<p>

Family members may be in one group, important colleagues may be in a second group, and friends in a third group.</p>

  <p><strong>Privacy Implications:</strong>This feature could in theory be implemented pre-authentication. Depending on the implementation, this would expose a users contats to the client in clear text. </p>
  <br/><br/>
  <p><strong>Existing Technologies:</strong> Would Web push notification with customization by the user satisfy the requirement here as opposed to introducing new semantics?</p>

    <br/><br/>
  <p><strong>Example User Experience:</strong> Question for the group. How would data be shared, if at all, between applications containing, for example, contacts and the proposed mechanism</p>
