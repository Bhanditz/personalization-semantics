                    <p>This proposal is to track the tasks that a user has done, so that they can be reminded of them, and return to or fix a task. The suggested syntax should allow the author to transform some of the information into breadcrumbs via CSS, and the user system can read and present more or less information to the user as per their preferences.</p>
                    <p>Preferably this should be in the header so that the user agent can build a cross application log of user tasks.</p>
                    <p>Note that there is no default value.</p>

                    <p>Note we are considering supporting an alternative syntax such as:</p>

    &lt;name>buy ticket&lt;/name>

                <h3>Reminders and Messages</h3>
                <p><strong>Requirement: </strong>We require an attribute that enables different users to experience different amount of reminders and messages based on personal preferences. Reminders are a wonderful tool for many people with cognitive disabilities. However too many reminders will be annoying or distracting for some other users. Currently people can turn off distractions such as Skype, and Facebook, across different devices, and then may forget to turn them back on.</p>
                <p>These semantics allow for different solutions so that users are able to focus without missing important messages. Users need to manage all distractions by forming a cross application and cross device distraction matrix that manages all distractions in one setting. It is based on a matrix for distractions at the operating system , browser or cloud level. People and users can be clustered in terms of importance or groups. For example, the CEO and your child's care giver could both be considered critical contacts. So even if they do not feel the message is urgent they can sometimes disrupt the user anyway. Some family members and important colleagues can be in another group, friends and extended family in a third group, system messages from the compliance system can be a different group again. </p>
