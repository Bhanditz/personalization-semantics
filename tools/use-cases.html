    <b>Requirement:</b> Users may have differences in both working and short-term memory. For some users the duration of working memory may be shorter than the average which is between 10-15 seconds. For some users the duration of short-term memory may be shorter than the average which is between 15-30 seconds.
    TODO - CLEAN UP BELOW 
    The user must be able to track all completed tasks in a sequence of tasks so they know where they are
    in the process and can be reminded of the tasks that are complete. In addition, the user must be able to navigate to
    any completed task and make corrections. The suggested syntax allows the author to transform some of the information
    into breadcrumbs that identify the completed tasks using CSS so that the user's system can present more or less information
    to the user based on the user's preferences.</p>
    <p><b>Example User Experience:</b> A breadcrumb displays in the header so that the user agent can build a 
      cross application step-by-step indicator that displays each task in the order it was completed 
      by the user.

  <h3>Reminders and Messages</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Requirement: </strong>We require an attribute that enables different users to experience different amount of reminders
    and messages based on personal preferences. Reminders are a wonderful tool for many people with cognitive disabilities.
    However too many reminders will be annoying or distracting for some other users. Currently people can turn off distractions
    such as Skype, and Facebook, across different devices, and then may forget to turn them back on.</p>
  <p>These semantics allow for different solutions so that users are able to focus without missing important messages. Users
    need to manage all distractions by forming a cross application and cross device distraction matrix that manages all distractions
    in one setting. It is based on a matrix for distractions at the operating system , browser or cloud level. People and
    users can be clustered in terms of importance or groups. For example, the CEO and your child's care giver could both
    be considered critical contacts. So even if they do not feel the message is urgent they can sometimes disrupt the user
    anyway. Some family members and important colleagues can be in another group, friends and extended family in a third
    group, system messages from the compliance system can be a different group again. </p>
